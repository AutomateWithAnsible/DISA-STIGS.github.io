          <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
The Docker Enterprise 2.x Linux/UNIX Security Technical Implementation Guide is published as a tool to improve the security of the Department of Defense (DoD) information systems.
			</p>
        <a name="authority">
          <h3>Authority</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
DoD Instruction (DoDI) 8500.01 requires that “all IT that receives, processes, stores, displays, 
or transmits DoD information will be […] configured […] consistent with applicable DoD cybersecurity policies, 
standards, and architectures” and tasks that Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) “develops and maintains 
control correlation identifiers (CCIs), security requirements guides (SRGs), security technical implementation 
guides (STIGs), and mobile code risk categories and usage guides that implement and are consistent with DoD 
cybersecurity policies, standards, architectures, security controls, and validation procedures, with the 
support of the NSA/CSS, using input from stakeholders, and using automation whenever possible.” This document 
is provided under the authority of DoDI 8500.01.
			</p>
        <p>
Although the use of the principles and guidelines in these SRGs/STIGs provides an environment that contributes 
to the security requirements of DoD systems, applicable NIST SP 800-53 cybersecurity controls need to be 
applied to all systems and architectures based on the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 
(CNSSI) 1253.

        <a name="severity">
          <h3>Vulnerability Severity Category Code Definitions</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
				Severity Category Codes (referred to as CAT) are a measure of vulnerabilities used to assess a
facility or system security posture. Each security policy specified in this document is assigned a
Severity Code of CAT I, II, or III.

          <h3>STIG Distribution</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
Parties within the DoD and Federal Government’s computing environments can obtain the applicable STIG from the Cyber Exchange website at 
<a href="https://cyber.mil/">https://cyber.mil/</a>. This site contains the latest copies of STIGs, SRGs, and other related security information. 
Those without a Common Access Card (CAC) that has DoD Certificates can obtain the STIG from <a href="https://public.cyber.mil/">https://public.cyber.mil/</a>.

        <a name="compliance">
          <h3>SRG Compliance Reporting</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
All technical NIST SP 800-53 requirements were considered while developing this STIG. Requirements that are applicable and configurable 
will be included in the final STIG. A report marked For Official Use Only (FOUO) will be available for those items that did not meet requirements. 
This report will be available to component Authorizing Official (AO) personnel for risk assessment purposes by request via email to: <a href="mailto:disa.stig_spt@mail.mil">disa.stig_spt@mail.mil</a>.
			</p>
        <a name="revisions">
          <h3>Document Revision Process</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
Comments or proposed revisions to this document should be sent via email to the following address: <a href="mailto:disa.stig_spt@mail.mil">disa.stig_spt@mail.mil</a>. 
DISA will coordinate all change requests with the relevant DoD organizations before inclusion in this document. Approved changes will be made in accordance with the DISA maintenance release schedule.
			</p>
        <a name="considerations">
          <h3>Other Considerations</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
DISA accepts no liability for the consequences of applying specific configuration settings made on the basis of the SRGs/STIGs. 
It must be noted that the configuration settings specified should be evaluated in a local, representative test environment before 
implementation in a production environment, especially within large user populations. The extensive variety of environments makes 
it impossible to test these configuration settings for all potential software configurations.
			</p>
        <p>
For some production environments, failure to test before implementation may lead to a loss of required functionality. Evaluating 
the risks and benefits to a system’s particular circumstances and requirements is the system owner’s responsibility. The evaluated 
risks resulting from not applying specified configuration settings must be approved by the responsible Authorizing Official. 
Furthermore, DISA implies no warranty that the application of all specified configurations will make a system 100 percent secure.
			</p>
        <p>
Security guidance is provided for the Department of Defense. While other agencies and organizations are free to use it, care must 
be given to ensure that all applicable security guidance is applied both at the device hardening level as well as the architectural 
level due to the fact that some of the settings may not be able to be configured in environments outside the DoD architecture.
			</p>
        <a name="disclaimer">
          <h3>Product Approval Disclaimer</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
The existence of a STIG does not equate to DoD approval for the procurement or use of a product.
			</p>
        <p>
STIGs provide configurable operational security guidance for products being used by the DoD. STIGs, along with vendor confidential 
documentation, also provide a basis for assessing compliance with Cybersecurity controls/control enhancements, which supports system 
Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) under the DoD Risk Management Framework (RMF). DoD Authorizing Officials (AOs) may request available 
vendor confidential documentation for a product that has a STIG for product evaluation and RMF purposes from <a href="mailto:disa.stig_spt@mail.mil">disa.stig_spt@mail.mil</a>. 
This documentation is not published for general access to protect the vendor’s proprietary information.
			</p>
        <p>
AOs have the purview to determine product use/approval IAW DoD policy and through RMF risk acceptance. Inputs into acquisition or pre-acquisition product selection include such processes as:
<ul><li>National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) evaluation for National Security Systems (NSS) (http://www.niap-ccevs.org/) IAW CNSSP #11</li><li>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/) IAW Federal/DoD mandated standards</li><li>DoD Unified Capabilities (UC) Approved Products List (APL) (http://www.disa.mil/network-services/ucco) IAW DoDI 8100.04</li></ul></p>

            <td class="ruledata">The UCP component of Docker Enterprise configures and leverages Swarm Mode for node-to-node cluster communication. Swarm Mode is built in to Docker Engine - Enterprise and uses TLS 1.2 at a minimum for encrypting communications. Under the hood, Swarm Mode includes an embedded public key infrastructure (PKI) system. When a UCP cluster is initialized, the first node in the cluster designates itself as a manager node. That node subsequently generates a new root Certificate Authority (CA) along with a key pair, which are used to secure communications with other UCP nodes that join the swarm. One can also specify his/her own externally-generated root CA upon initialization of a UCP cluster. The manager node also generates two tokens to use when joining additional nodes to the cluster: one worker token and one manager token. Each token includes the digest of the root CA’s certificate and a randomly generated secret. When a node joins the cluster, the joining node uses the digest to validate the root CA certificate from the remote manager. The remote manager uses the secret to ensure the joining node is an approved node. Each time a new node joins the cluster, the manager issues a certificate to the node. The certificate contains a randomly generated node ID to identify the node under the certificate common name (CN) and the role under the organizational unit (OU). The node ID serves as the cryptographically secure node identity for the lifetime of the node in the current swarm. In this mutual TLS architecture, all nodes encrypt communications using a minimum of TLS 1.2, thereby satisfying the requirements of this control. This information can also be referenced at https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/pki/ and https://docs.docker.com/ee/ucp/ucp-architecture/.<br/>
<br/>
By itself, Docker Engine - Enterprise is configured by default to listen for API requests via a UNIX domain socket (or IPC socket) created at /var/run/docker.sock on supported Linux distributions and via a named pipe at npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine on Windows Server 2016 and newer. Docker Engine - Enterprise can also be configured to listen for API requests via additional socket types, including both TCP and FD (only on supported systemd-based Linux distributions). If configured to listen for API requests via the TCP socket type over TCP port 2376 and with the daemon flags and SSL certificates, then, at a minimum, TLS 1.2 is used for encryption; therefore this control is applicable and is inherently met in this configuration. If configured to listen for API requests via the TCP socket type, but without TLS verification and certifications, then the instance remains vulnerable and is not properly configured to meet the requirements of this control. If configured to listen for API requests via the FD socket type, then this control is not applicable. More information can be found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option. The TCP socket binding should be disabled when running Engine as part of a UCP cluster.<br/>

            <td class="ruledata">The Universal Control Plane (UCP) and Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) components of Docker Enterprise provide audit record generation capabilities. Audit logs capture all HTTP actions for the following endpoints: Kubernetes API, Swarm API and UCP API. The following UCP API endpoints are excluded from audit logging (where "*" designates a wildcard of exclusions): "/_ping", "/ca", "/auth", "/trustedregistryca", "/kubeauth", "/metrics", "/info", "/version*", "/debug", "/openid_keys", "/apidocs", "kubernetesdocs" and "/manage". Audit log verbosity can be set to one of the following levels: "none", "metadata", or "request". To meet the requirements of this control, the "request" verbosity level must be configured in UCP.<br/>
<br/>
The data captured at each level for UCP and the eNZI authentication and authorization backplane is described below:<br/>
<br/>
"none": audit logging is disabled<br/>
<br/>
"metadata":<br/>
 - method and API endpoint for the request<br/>
 - UCP user which made the request<br/>
 - response status (success/failure)<br/>
 - timestamp of the call<br/>
 - object ID of created/updated resource (for create/update calls)<br/>
 - license key<br/>
 - remote address<br/>
<br/>
"request": includes all fields from the "metadata" level, as well as the request payload<br/>
<br/>
DTR audits all events associated with repository activities. Events are considered as follows: create, get, delete, update, send, fail, and scan. The following types are associated with the defined audit events: repository, tag, blob, manifest, webhook, uri, promotion, push mirroring, poll mirroring, garbage collector, system.<br/>

The eNZi backplane includes its own managed user database, and also allows for LDAP integration in UCP and DTR.

<br/>
PID namespace provides separation of processes. The PID Namespace removes the view of the system processes, and allows process IDs to be reused including PID 1. If the host's PID namespace is shared with the container, it would allow processes within the container to see all of the processes on the host system. This breaks the benefit of process level isolation between the host and the containers. Someone having access to the container can eventually know all the processes running on the host system and can even kill the host system processes from within the container. Hence, do not share the host's process namespace with the containers.<br/>
<br/>
Container processes cannot see the processes on the host system. In certain cases, the container should share the host's process namespace. For example, the user could build a container with debugging tools like strace or gdb, but want to use these tools when debugging processes within the container. If this is desired, then share only one (or needed) host process by using the -p switch.<br/>

Example:<br/>
docker run --pid=host rhel7 strace -p 1234<br/>

Audit log verbosity can be set to one of the following levels: "none", "metadata", or "request". To meet the requirements of this control, the "request" verbosity level must be configured in UCP.<br/>

 - response status (success/failure)<br/>
 - timestamp of the call<br/>

DTR audits all events associated with repository activities. Events are considered as follows: create, get, delete, update, send, fail, and scan. The following types are associated with the defined audit events: repository, tag, blob, manifest, webhook, uri, promotion, push mirroring, poll mirroring, garbage collector, system.<br/>
<br/>
All audit logs generated by UCP and DTR can be forwarded to a remote log aggregation system by configuring an appropriate log driver plugin on all Docker Engine - Enterprise nodes in a cluster.<br/>

By default, CPU time is divided between containers equally. If it is desired, to control the CPU time amongst the container instances, use CPU sharing feature. CPU sharing allows to prioritize one container over the other and forbids the lower priority container to claim CPU resources more often. This ensures that the high priority containers are served better.<br/>
<br/>
If CPU shares are not properly set, the container process may have to starve if the resources on the host are not available. If the CPU resources on the host are free, CPU shares do not place any restrictions on the CPU that the container may use.<br/>

<br/>
Manage the CPU shares between containers. To do so, start the container using the --cpu-shares argument.<br/>
<br/>
For example, run a container as below:<br/>
<br/>
docker run --interactive --tty --cpu-shares 512 [image] [command]<br/>
<br/>
In the above example, the container is started with CPU shares of 50% of what the other containers use. So, if the other container has CPU shares of 80%, this container will have CPU shares of 40%.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Every new container will have 1024 shares of CPU by default. However, this value is shown as 0 if running the command mentioned in the audit section.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively,<br/>
<br/>
1. Navigate to /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/system.slice/ directory.<br/>
2. Check the container instance ID using docker ps.<br/>
3. Now, inside the above directory (in step 1), there will be a directory by name docker-&lt;Instance ID&gt;.scope. For example, docker-4acae729e8659c6be696ee35b2237cc1fe4edd2672e9186434c5116e1a6fbed6.scope. Navigate to this directory.<br/>
4. Find a file named cpu.shares. Execute cat cpu.shares. This will always show the CPU share value based on the system. So, even if there is no CPU shares configured using -c or --cpu-shares argument in the docker run command, this file will have a value of 1024.<br/>
<br/>
By setting one container’s CPU shares to 512, it will receive half of the CPU time compared to the other container. So, take 1024 as 100% and then do quick math to derive the number that set for respective CPU shares. For example, use 512 to set 50% and 256 to set 25%.</td>

Enabling this option forces containers at runtime to explicitly define their data writing strategy to persist or not persist their data. This also reduces security attack vectors since the container instance's filesystem cannot be tampered with or written to unless it has explicit read-write permissions on its filesystem folder and directories.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling --read-only at container runtime may break some container OS packages if a data writing strategy is not defined. Define what the container's data should and should not persist at runtime to determine which recommendation procedure to utilize.<br/>

Example:<br/>
<br/>
- Enable use --tmpfs for temporary file writes to /tmp<br/>

System administrators typically define cgroups under which containers are supposed to run. Even if cgroups are not explicitly defined by the system administrators, containers run under docker cgroup by default. At run-time, it is possible to attach to a different cgroup other than the one that was expected to be used. This usage should be monitored and confirmed. By attaching to a different cgroup than the one that is expected, excess permissions and resources might be granted to the container and thus, can prove to be unsafe.<br/>

A process can set the no_new_priv bit in the kernel. It persists across fork, clone, and execve. The no_new_priv bit ensures that the process or its children processes do not gain any additional privileges via suid or sgid bits. This way a lot of dangerous operations become a lot less dangerous because there is no possibility of subverting privileged binaries.<br/>

no_new_priv prevents LSMs like SELinux from transitioning to process labels that have access not allowed to the current process.<br/>

<br/>
By default, if the user does not specifically declare the container port to host port mapping, Docker automatically and correctly maps the container port to one available in 49153-65535 block on the host. But, Docker allows a container port to be mapped to a privileged port on the host if the user explicitly declared it. This is so because containers are executed with NET_BIND_SERVICE Linux kernel capability that does not restrict the privileged port mapping. The privileged ports receive and transmit various sensitive and privileged data. Allowing containers to use them can bring serious implications.</td>

If there are multiple network interfaces on the host machine, the container can accept connections on the exposed ports on any network interface. This might not be desired and may not be secured.

Hence, do not accept incoming connections on any interface. Only allow incoming connections from a particular external interface.<br/>

            <td class="ruledata">The Universal Control Plane (UCP) component of Docker Enterprise includes a built-in access authorization mechanism called eNZi which can be integrated with an LDAP server and subsequently terminate all network connections associated with a communications session at the end of the session, or as follows: for in-band management sessions (privileged sessions), the session must be terminated after 10 minutes of inactivity; and for user sessions (non-privileged session), the session must be terminated after 15 minutes of inactivity, except to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements. The lifetime minutes login session control is configured with a default of 60 minutes (1 hour) and the renewal threshold minutes is configured with a default of 20 minutes. For reference, the lifetime login session control in UCP specifies the initial lifetime (in minutes) of a session from the moment it is generated. The renewal threshold setting indicates a period of time (in minutes) before the expiration of a session where, if used, a session will be extended by the current configured lifetime from then. This value cannot be greater than the configured lifetime. A value equal to the lifetime means that sessions will be extended with every use. A value of zero indicates that sessions should never be extended but this may result in unexpectedly being logged out if the session expires while performing a series of actions in the UI. This configuration only applies to both the UCP and Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) management consoles and not when connecting via the command line. When connecting via the command line, this control is not applicable.<br/>
<br/>
It's important to note that the notion of a session varies depending on how one is connecting to a UCP cluster or DTR. In all of these cases, there is no specific session termination capability. Either the session times out, the user's client bundle has expired, or a user explicitly logs out. This has been outlined as follows:<br/>
<br/>

- the session expires based on the values configured for "Lifetime Minutes" and "Renewal Threshold Minutes" in the UCP Admin Settings<br/>
- the user explicitly clicks the "Sign Out" button<br/>
<br/>
(UCP and DTR CLIs) When connecting to a UCP cluster or DTR via the command line using a client bundle, a user's session is active until any of the following conditions is met:<br/>
- the certificate contained within a user's client bundle hasn't expired<br/>
- the public key in the certificate contained with a user's client bundle is no long associated with that user (i.e. a client bundle is revoked from within the UCP user management options)<br/>
- the user's account is no longer active (either explicitly disabled from within the UCP user management options or at the LDAP server)<br/>
- the user's password is changed<br/>

In this configuration, this control is not applicable. Docker Engine - Enterprise can also be configured to listen for API requests via additional socket types, including both TCP and FD (only on supported systemd-based Linux distributions). If configured to listen for API requests via the TCP socket type over TCP port 2376 and with the daemon flags and SSL certificates, then, at a minimum, TLS 1.2 is used for encryption; therefore this control is applicable and is inherently met in this configuration. If configured to listen for API requests via the TCP socket type, but without TLS verification and certifications, then the instance remains vulnerable and is not properly configured to meet the requirements of this control. If configured to listen for API requests via the fd socket type, then this control is not applicable. More information can be found at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-socket-option. The TCP socket binding should be disabled when running Engine as part of a UCP cluster.<br/>

A container can be run just with the ports defined in the Dockerfile for its image or can be arbitrarily passed run time parameters to open a list of ports. Additionally, over time, Dockerfiles may undergo various changes and the list of exposed ports may or may not be relevant to the application running within the container. Opening unneeded ports increase the attack surface of the container and the containerized application. Per the requirements set forth by the System Security Plan (SSP), ensure only needed ports are open on all running containers.</td>

<br/>
If indefinitely trying to start the container, it could possibly lead to a denial of service on the host. It could be an easy way to do a distributed denial of service attack especially if there are many containers on the same host. Additionally, ignoring the exit status of the container and always attempting to restart the container leads to non-investigation of the root cause behind containers getting terminated. If a container gets terminated, investigate on the reason behind it instead of just attempting to restart it indefinitely. Thus, it is recommended to use on-failure restart policy and limit it to maximum of 5 restart attempts.<br/>

The container would attempt to restart only for 5 times.<br/>

The default ulimit set at the Docker daemon level should be honored. If the default ulimit settings are not appropriate for a particular container instance, override them as an exception.

In the context of Docker Enterprise, software would be analogous to Docker images that have been pulled from trusted or untrusted sources. Docker Hub is the most common upstream endpoint for retrieving Docker images. However, only "Docker Certified" images on Docker Hub are considered trusted and come with SLAs and trusted signatures from their respective vendors.

Therefore, to meet the requirements of this control, it is imperative that UCP has LDAP integration enabled and that content trust enforcement is enabled and properly configured.<br/>
<br/>
The UCP and DTR components of Docker Enterprise provide audit record generation capabilities. Audit logs capture all HTTP actions for the following endpoints: Kubernetes API, Swarm API and UCP API. The following UCP API endpoints are excluded from audit logging (where "*" designates a wildcard of exclusions): "/_ping", "/ca", "/auth", "/trustedregistryca", "/kubeauth", "/metrics", "/info", "/version*", "/debug", "/openid_keys", "/apidocs", "kubernetesdocs" and "/manage". Audit log verbosity can be set to one of the following levels: "none", "metadata", or "request". To meet the requirements of this control, the "request" verbosity level must be configured in UCP.<br/>
<br/>
The data captured at each level for UCP and the eNZI authentication and authorization backplane is described below:<br/>
<br/>
"none": audit logging is disabled<br/>
<br/>
"metadata":<br/>
 - method and API endpoint for the request<br/>
 - UCP user which made the request<br/>
 - response status (success/failure)<br/>
 - timestamp of the call<br/>
 - object ID of created/updated resource (for create/update calls)<br/>
 - license key<br/>
 - remote address<br/>
<br/>
"request": includes all fields from the "metadata" level, as well as the request payload<br/>
<br/>
DTR audits all events associated with repository activities. Events are considered as follows: create, get, delete, update, send, fail, and scan. The following types are associated with the defined audit events: repository, tag, blob, manifest, webhook, uri, promotion, push mirroring, poll mirroring, garbage collector, system.<br/>
<br/>
The Docker Engine - Enterprise component of Docker Enterprise relies on the underlying host operating system's auditing capabilities. By default, the host OS is not configured to audit Docker Engine - Enterprise.</td>

Docker daemon runs as root. The default UNIX socket hence must be owned by root.

Also, such a non-privileged user or process might interact with containers. This is neither secure nor desired behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the Docker installer creates a UNIX group called docker. Users can be added to this group, and then those users would be able to read and write to default Docker UNIX socket. The membership to the docker group is tightly controlled by the system administrator. If any other group owns this socket, then it might be possible for members of that group to interact with Docker daemon. Also, such a group might not be as tightly controlled as the docker group. This is neither secure nor desired behavior.<br/>

<br/>
UCP establishes mutual TLS authentication for all Engine - Enterprise nodes in a cluster using a built-in certificate authority which inherently meets the requirements of this control. This is described below.<br/>
<br/>
The UCP component of Docker Enterprise includes a built-in public key infrastructure (PKI) system. When a UCP cluster is initialized, the first node designates itself as a manager node. That node subsequently generates a new root CA along with a key pair, which are used to secure communications with other UCP manager and worker nodes that are joined to the cluster. One can also specify his/her own externally-generated root CA upon initialization of a UCP cluster. The manager node also generates two tokens to use when joining additional nodes to the cluster: one worker token and one manager token. Each token includes the digest of the root CA’s certificate and a randomly generated secret. When a node joins the cluster, the joining node uses the digest to validate the root CA certificate from the remote manager. The remote manager uses the secret to ensure the joining node is an approved node. Each time a new node joins the cluster, the manager issues a certificate to the node. The certificate contains a randomly generated node ID to identify the node under the certificate common name (CN) and the role under the organizational unit (OU). The node ID serves as the cryptographically secure node identity for the lifetime of the node in the current UCP cluster. In this mutual TLS architecture, all nodes encrypt communications using a minimum of TLS 1.2. This information can also be referenced at https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/how-swarm-mode-works/pki/.</td>

Linux: As a superuser, execute the following commands on each UCP Manager node in the cluster and in the directory where keys and certificates are located:<br/>

Create a container that attaches to the same volume where certificates are stored:<br/>
<br/>
docker create --name replace-certs -v ucp-controller-server-certs:/data busybox<br/>

docker cp key.pem replace-certs:/data/key.pem<br/>

docker rm replace-certs<br/>

Restart the ucp-controller container:<br/>

docker restart ucp-controller<br/>

            <td class="ruledata">By default, the docker swarm services will listen to all interfaces on the host, which may not be necessary for the operation of the swarm where the host has multiple network interfaces.<br/>
<br/>
When a swarm is initialized the default value for the --listen-addr flag is 0.0.0.0:2377 which means that the swarm services will listen on all interfaces on the host. If a host has multiple network interfaces this may be undesirable as it may expose the docker swarm services to networks which are not involved in the operation of the swarm.<br/>
<br/>
By passing a specific IP address to the --listen-addr, a specific network interface can be specified limiting this exposure.</td>

<br/>
Linux: List the network listener on port 2377/TCP (the default for docker swarm) and confirm that it is only listening on specific interfaces. For example, using ubuntu this could be done with the following command:<br/>
<br/>
netstat -lt | grep -i 2377<br/>
<br/>
If the swarm service is not bound to a specific host interface address, this is a finding.</td>
